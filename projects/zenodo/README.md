This project folders contains scripts that reformat the training data set of the proposed optical water type classification framework (Bi and Hieronymi 2024). The data set is now accessible in https://zenodo.org/records/12803329.

The path in the scripts might be different from the current setup as the structure reconstruction is done on another working environment.

Note that due to some GitHub policy, some large files are ignored for restoring in this repo, please find them in zenodo link or aks me directly via shun.bi@outlook.com
